# search-text-from-srt
A simple python application, which can search text from srt files. 

This app is built to help you find specific text in subtitle files (SRT) located in a particular folder directory. You just need to input the text you're looking for, and the app will show you a list of SRT files along with the timestamps when that text appears. The results are neatly grouped by the folders where the text is found, making it easy for you to see where the text is located in your files.
